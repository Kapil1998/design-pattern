Proxy Pattern
-

The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that involves the creation of a surrogate or placeholder object (the proxy) to control access to another object (the real subject). The proxy acts as an intermediary, allowing the client to interact with the real subject indirectly. This pattern is used to add an additional layer of control, protection, or functionality to the real subject without directly modifying its code.

When to Use the Proxy Pattern:
-

1. Virtual Proxies: Use a proxy to create resource-intensive objects only when they are actually needed (lazy loading). This is particularly useful for improving performance and memory usage.

2. Remote Proxies: Use a proxy to represent an object that is located remotely, such as in a different address space or on a remote server. The proxy handles communication and marshalling between the client and the remote object.

3. Protection Proxies: Use a proxy to control access to sensitive or restricted operations on an object. The proxy can enforce access permissions and prevent unauthorized operations.

4. Logging and Auditing: Use a proxy to log method calls and interactions with the real subject for auditing purposes or to gather statistics.

5. Caching: Use a proxy to implement caching mechanisms. The proxy can store the results of expensive operations and return cached results when the same operation is requested again.

Benefits of Using the Proxy Pattern:
-

1. Separation of Concerns: The proxy allows you to separate the concerns of an object's core functionality from additional responsibilities like access control, caching, or logging.

2. Security and Access Control: Proxies can control and restrict access to certain functionalities of the real subject, enforcing security measures.

3. Lazy Loading: The proxy can defer the creation or initialization of resource-intensive objects until they are actually needed, improving application startup time and memory usage.

4. Improved Performance: By using proxies for caching, you can improve the performance of repeated operations by returning cached results.

5. Remote Communication: Proxies can handle the complexities of remote communication, making it easier to work with objects located in different processes or systems.

6. Transparent Interaction: Clients interacting with proxies can usually do so in the same way they would interact with the real subjects, making the usage transparent.

7. Easy Extension: You can introduce new proxy types with different behaviors without altering the code of the real subjects.

8. Reduced Coupling: The proxy pattern helps in reducing direct dependencies between clients and real subjects, promoting loose coupling.
