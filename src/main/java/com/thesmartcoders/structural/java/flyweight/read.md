Flyweight Design Pattern
-

The Flyweight Design Pattern is a structural pattern that aims to reduce memory usage by sharing common parts of object states among multiple objects. It's particularly useful when dealing with a large number of objects that have similar properties, and the goal is to save memory by reusing shared state rather than duplicating it in each individual object. This pattern is especially beneficial when memory consumption is a concern.

**When to Use the Flyweight Pattern:**

1. **Large Number of Objects:** When you need to manage a significant number of objects that share common properties, and individual objects are consuming too much memory.

2. **Immutable Objects:** When the objects are immutable (their state cannot be changed), making them suitable for sharing.

3. **State Segregation:** When you can segregate an object's state into intrinsic (shared) and extrinsic (context-specific) parts. The intrinsic state can be shared among objects.

4. **Memory Efficiency:** When memory usage is a concern, and you want to optimize it by reusing shared state.

**Pros of Using the Flyweight Pattern:**

1. **Memory Efficiency:** By sharing common state among objects, the Flyweight Pattern reduces memory consumption, especially when dealing with a large number of similar objects.

2. **Performance Improvement:** With reduced memory usage, there can be potential performance improvements due to reduced data fetching and caching.

3. **Reuse of State:** Objects with the same intrinsic state are reused, leading to better resource utilization.

4. **Simplicity in Context:** Extrinsic state (context-specific information) can be managed externally, simplifying the individual flyweight objects.

**Cons of Using the Flyweight Pattern:**

1. **Complexity:** The pattern can introduce additional complexity, as it requires separating intrinsic and extrinsic state and managing the interactions between them.

2. **Thread Safety:** Shared state can introduce thread safety concerns, requiring synchronization mechanisms if accessed concurrently.

3. **Performance Overhead:** While memory consumption is reduced, the pattern might introduce some overhead due to the need to manage and retrieve shared state.

4. **Reduced Object Encapsulation:** The pattern might result in less encapsulation as the intrinsic state is shared among multiple objects.
